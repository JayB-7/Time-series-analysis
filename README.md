# Time-series-analysis
### Name of the project: Analysing and predicting the Istanbul stock market dataset
### Repository: UCI machine learning repository 
### About: 
- The objective of this project is to predict the value of a stock exchange, when the values of 
the other stock exchanges are given. Using statistical models like ARIMA, VAR and machine 
learning models like XGBoost, trying to find the model for best prediction.

- A model is created which can predict the value of a stock exchange when inputs are given

- Tools used:
    - Python - sklearn for model building
    - IDE - Google Colab notebooks
